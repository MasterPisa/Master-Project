# Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)
The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an international study conducted by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. This project conduct a multi level data analysis of following four data sets:

### Student results which include the student background questionnaire as well as the outcomes of the math, science, and reading assessments (data(pisa.student))
### School results from the school questionnaire (data(pisa.school))
### Parent results from the parent questionnaire (data(pisa.parent))
### The detailed item results from the cognitive assessments (data(pisa.items))

Here are some useful resources for getting started with PISA:

PISA 2009 at a Glance
What PISA Assess
PISA Database and Codebook Access

PISA 2018 - there is not that much paper available right now
the theory is very huge- one domain would be enough
global competence would be a good focus for the amount of people
Focus on the methodology part and practical usage with students & schools HLM
maybe we could choose one country of each European area -> not need to this additionally
How to use the weights, Mario knows already how to use
Usage R Studio with package remix
For the models: Comparison of different models,
1. easy one
2. Specializes to the level of the students,
3. one that is specialized to the schools
The gain from HLM -comparison of normal presentation and HLM presetation to the press
When working with regression we need a control variable into the model - at the students level wit migrational backgrounds (2-3 of them, not all) -> Julia will send us a paper
descriptive part within the analysis is always nice to see
